Hey, I'm Aayush. 

I started this page with the intention of documenting all the awesome (and some not) 
stuff that I do so that it can help others and myself.

A quick introduction-

I'm currently in my fourth year of B.Tech, pursuing Double Majors in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, from IIT Kanpur. I like all things sciene and math, and I have done courses among all the levels of the tech stack, learning everyday and trying to find where my calling really lies.

I really like Competitive Programming, although I'm struggling to be regular there nowadays, my CF handle is [maejik] (https://codeforces.com/profile/maejik). 

In the current semester, I'm doing CS330 (OS), 345 (Algorithms II), 340 (TOC), 690 (Computational Genomics) and a UGP focussed in Spatial Transcriptonomics.

I'll be spending my next summers as a SWE intern at Rubrik US.
